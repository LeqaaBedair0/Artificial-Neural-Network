## Neural Network Architecture Portfolio
The projects cover a wide range of architectures, from traditional function approximation to modern generative modeling and unsupervised feature extraction.

## 🧠 Contents & Architectures
  The portfolio is organized by network paradigm:
    Generative Networks: 
      GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks): Implementation of a Generator-Discriminator architecture for synthetic data generation.
      Includes both .ipynb and .py versions for flexible execution.
    Unsupervised Learning:
      SOM (Self-Organizing Maps): Competitive learning implementation for low-dimensional mapping of complex input data.
      ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory): An implementation of the ART algorithm for stable category learning of binary patterns.
    Function Approximation:
      RBF (Radial Basis Function Networks): A neural network utilizing radial basis activation functions, commonly used for function approximation and regression.
    Mathematics for Neural Networks:
      PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Dimensionality reduction techniques used for feature extraction and data preprocessing in neural pipelines.
